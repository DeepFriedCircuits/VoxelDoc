=========

When using voxels, you usually want to be able to have any material on each voxel.
When using smooth voxels like marching cubes, you also want those materials to blend smoothly and not change abruptly.
In other words, you want to be able to blend any material with any other.

There are multiple use cases:

* Your materials are just colors: see TODO
* Your materials have textures: see TODO and TODO
